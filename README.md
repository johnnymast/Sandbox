Redbox-hooks allow you use Wordpress actions and filters in your own code. The syntax is easy to use as you expect it to be after seeing it in Wordpress it self.

If you want to look at some demo's in details then read the manual for:
 
* [Filters](FILTERS.md)
* [Actions](ACTIONS.md)

#Fun fact
I a am not a TDD guy but 50% of this code was written with the TDD concept in mind. Actually i was pretty much surprised on how it worked out and the speed the development came in.


## Requirements

The following versions of PHP are supported by this version.

+ PHP 5.6
+ PHP 7.0
+ PHP 7.1
+ HHVM

## Known issues

If you come across a bug/issue you can always report them to the [issue tracker](issues). While developing this package this is something things
i noticed. Those things are listed below.

### Filter/Action function callback is not called
If you have functions inside a namespace. So should add the full namespace to the callback function like this example here.

```php
namespace Sandbox\Demos;

use Sandbox\Filters;

function func_first($text = '')
{
    return '!!' . $text;
}
Filters::addFilter('prepend_at', 'Sandbox\Demos\func_first', 0);
```
